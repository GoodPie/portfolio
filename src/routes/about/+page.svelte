				I'm a dedicated software engineer with a proven track record building and maintaining multiple
				projects within the education and health sector. I have a passion for building software that
				provides value to the end user and is easy to use.
			</p>

			<p class='mb-2'>
				Before transitioning to the tech industry, I served as a support worker for several years. This
				experience not only honed my communication skills but also gave me a unique perspective on how
				technology can be used to improve the lives of others. It has become my driving force to
				improve the industry in any way I can.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to my profession pursuits, I am a keen home cook, avid Ice Hockey fan (AIHL - Perth Thunder)
				and a lover of travel. Whilst I've had the opportunity to backpack accross Australia with some amazing
				people, I haven't been fortunate enough to venture overseas yet. I hope to change that in the near future.
